mvector
-------
 A minimal SUM(vector<T>, T) type. Useful in the regex case where we go from
 using an NFA (multiple routes per symbol out of a node) to a DFA (a single
 route per symbol out of the node). It means we don't have to allocate a bunch
 more memory.

RegexLexer
----------
 A regex implementation that has 'tagged' nodes, matching returns that tag.
 Written so that when I am writing lexers I don't have to do so much busy
 work.
